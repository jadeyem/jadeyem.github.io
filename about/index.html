        <h1>Background</h1>
	<p>I'm a University of Waterloo Electrical and Computer Engineering Graduate, Class of 2018. 
		Currently experiencing the life of an ASIC SoC Design Verfication Engineer @ AMD in Ontario, Canada.
		I began my journey into engineering because I wanted to learn "how things work". I stayed because I get to do that and build things.
