So it's been a couple weeks since my first post and I haven't really done much on my personal website. Part of it is that I've been busy with work on the weekdays. The other part is that I'm not sure if this site really has a purpose, or at least one important enough to spend any time on it. Or maybe I'm just lazy and am making up excuses - it wouldn't be the first time, hehe. Well for now the main purpose I can think of for this website is kind of replicating the information I have on LinkedIn onto here. That way when I get tired of another social media(-ish) website, I can still have all my professional info somewhere. I guess I can also use this as a creative outlet, but I have other things for that. Yeah, so for now just professional information as simply as I possibly can. Well, that's all for now.
